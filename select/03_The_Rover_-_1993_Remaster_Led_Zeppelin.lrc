[01:08.17] I've been to London, seen seven wonders
[01:12.98] I know to trip is just to fall
[01:17.78] I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
[01:22.30] I always knew what it was for
[01:36.80] 
[01:29.73] There can be no denyin' that the wind'll shake 'em down
[01:38.87] And the flag we're flyin' is the new flag of the land
[01:46.46] Just join hands
[01:48.66] If we could just join hands
[01:50.81] If we could just join
[02:01.31] 
[01:52.94] With fields aplenty when Heaven sent me
[01:56.92] I saw the kings who ruled them all
[02:01.57] Still by the firelight and purple moonlight
[02:06.91] I hear the rustic river's call
[02:21.91] 
[02:14.15] And the wind is cryin' from a love that won't grow cold
[02:23.19] My lover, she is lyin' on the dark side of the globe
[02:49.19] 
[02:30.73] Could just join hands
[02:32.99] If we could just join hands
[02:35.45] If we could just join hands, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[03:05.47] Keep me rockin' baby, can you keep me strollin'
[03:08.99] Won't cha tell me, darlin', which way to go, that's right
[03:37.49] 
[03:39.81] Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry
[03:44.50] And I would dearly like to know
[03:49.32] How all this squander of earthly plunder
[03:54.09] Will leave us anything to show
[04:09.09] 
[04:01.16] And our time is flyin'
[04:05.52] See the candle burnin' low
[04:10.43] Is the new world risin'
[04:14.85] From the shambles of the old
[04:28.85]
