I've been to london seen seven wonders i know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it sometimes i'd roll it i always knew what it was for
There can be no denying that the wind will shake them down
And the flat world's flying there's a new flag on the land
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
Traversed the planet when heaven sent me i saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight i hear the wrested rivers call
And the wind is crying from a love that won't grow cold
My lover she is lying on the dark side of the globe
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
You got me rocking when i ought to be rolling
Darling tell me darling which way to go
You keep me rocking baby then you keep me stolen
Won't you tell me darling which way to go
That's right
Oh how i wonder oh how i worry and i would dearly like to know
Of all this wonder of earthly plunder will leave us anything to show
And our time is flying see the candle burning low
Is the new world rising from the shambles of the old?
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just if we could just if we could just if we could just if we could just join hands
That's all it takes that's all it takes
That's all it takes that's all it takes
That's right that's right that's right that's right
